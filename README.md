# Gravity Forms NO Duplicates
### Updated snippet from Gravity Wiz for Gravity Forms 2.3.6 +
Found this great snippet [here](https://gravitywiz.com/better-limit-submission-per-time-period-by-user-or-ip/) to help limit how many times in a certain time period a person can submit form but it didn't work with the latest version of Gravity Forms (2.3.6). I updated it just a bit to get it working.
